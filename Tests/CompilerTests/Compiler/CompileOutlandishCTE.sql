/*
 This contains some examples from SQLite's own documentation on
 https://sqlite.org/lang_with.html
 
 They are labeled as "Outlandish" in the docs title and figured would
 be some great tests to really test out the behviour of CTEs to
 make sure they match SQLite even in the most extreme use cases.
