  A fast, lightweight SQLite library for Swift
</p>

## Overview
Otter generates type safe code from raw plain SQL.

## Basic Usage
As a primer here is a quick example. Below is some SQL. The first part is in the `/Migrations` directory. This is where you can create and modify your schema. The second part is in the `/Queries` directory.
```sql
-- Located in Migrations/1.sql
CREATE TABLE todo (
  id INTEGER,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  completedOn INTEGER
)

-- Located in Queries/Todo.sql
DEFINE QUERY selectTodos AS
SELECT * FROM todo;
```
Would generate the following Swift code
```swift
let db = DB()
let todos = try await db.selectTodos.execute()

for todo in todos {
  print(todo.id, todo.name, todo.completedOn)
}

for try await todos in db.selectTodos.observe() {
  print("Got todos", todos)
}
```

## Dependency Injection
> TLDR; Avoid the repository pattern, inject queries.

Otter was written with application development in mind. One of the common walls when talking to a database is dependecy injection. 
Normally this would mean wrapping your database calls in a repository or some other layer to keep the model layer testable without needing a database connection. 
This is all good but that means writing different protocols and mocks. When writing the protocol you need to decide whether to just make it `async` or maybe a `publisher`. 
Sometimes you need both... Otter solves these problems and was designed to have injection builtin.

At the core, Otter exposes one core type for injections which is `any Query<Input, Output>`. This acts as a wrapper, which knows nothing about the database that can passed into a model or view model. For example, if we have a query that takes in an `Int` and returns a `String` we can setup our view model like:
```swift
class ViewModel {
  let fetchString: any Query<Int, String>
}
```

Then in your live application code that will actually ship to users you can pass in your database query
```swift
let viewModel = ViewModel(fetchString: database.fetchString)
```

In unit tests or previews where you don't want a database you can pass a `Just` or a `Fail`
```swift
let viewModel = ViewModel(fetchString: Queries.Just("Just a string, no database needed üòé"))

// Will throw the `MockError` any time the query is executed
let alwaysFails = ViewModel(fetchString: Queries.Fail(MockError()))
```

#### Injecting Type Aliases
The example above is nice but doesn't really represent the common use case. 
Most of the time we don't just have a query that has an input and output of simple builtins. 
They can be larger generated structs which can be a lot to type. To fix this typealiases are
generated for a query to give them a simple readable name. For example
```sql
DEFINE QUERY latestExpenses AS
SELECT id, title, amount FROM expense
WHERE date BETWEEN ? AND ?;
```
Would generate the following `typealias` for injection
```swift
class ViewModel {
  // Equivalent to `any Query<LatestExpensesInput, LatestExpensesOutput>`
  let query: any LatestExpensesQuery
}
```

## Swift Macros
> TLDR; Don't use for larger projects ‚ö†Ô∏è

Otter can even run within a Swift macro by adding the `@Database` macro to a `struct`. As of now it is not recommended for larger projects. 
There are quite a few limitations that won't scale well beyond a fairly simple schema and a handfull of queries.

```swift
@Database
struct DB {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM foo")
    var selectFooQuery: SelectFooDatabaseQuery

    @Query("INSERT INTO foo (bar, baz) VALUES (?, ?)", inputName: "FooInput")
    var insertFooQuery: InsertFooDatabaseQuery
    
    static var migrations: [String] {
        return [
            "CREATE TABLE foo (bar INTEGER, baz TEXT);"
        ]
    }
}

func main() async throws {
    let database = try DB.inMemory()
    try await database.insertFooQuery.execute(with: .init(bar: 1, baz: "Baz"))
    let foos = try await database.selectFooQuery.execute()
    print(foos)
}
```

### Current Limitations
* Since macros operate purely on the syntax, all queries must be within the `@Database` itself so the schema can be inferred properly.
* All generated types will be nested under the `@Database` struct.
* All `@Query` definitions must define their type as the generated `typealias` by the `@Database` macro.
* Any diagnostics will be on the entire string rather than the part that actually failed.
